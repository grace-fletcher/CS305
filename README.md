This repository includes my Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report as well as my answers to the journal questions. 

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that deals with financial information surrounding various entrepreneurs, businesses, and government agencies around the world. They develop individualized financial plans for these businesses and agencies, and these financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They are looking to enhance their online banking software by incorporating security measures.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**

One thing that I did well was incorporate an algorithm cipher (SHA-256) into the existing code to address security vulnerabilities. It is important to code securely and to keep software security in mind to keep customer data safe. This is important to the company's overall wellbeing, as if they start to lose customers due to security issues within their software, they will lose money.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

Throughout this course, I consistently struggled with generating checksum verifications. 

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

One way that I increased the layers of security is by implementing a cryptographic algorithm cipher. In the future, I would use Maven dependency checks to assess vulnerabilities.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

I ran the code multiple times to see if there were any errors to make sure that it was functional. To check to see whether I introduced new vulnerabilities, I ran Maven dependency checks.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

One resource that was very helpful when I got stuck in this course was the SNHU discord server. I plan on using this discord server in my future classes.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I might show my future employers both Project One and Project Two.
